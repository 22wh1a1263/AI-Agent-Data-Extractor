An AI-powered data extraction dashboard.

Abstract
The AI Agent Data Extractor is an intelligent system designed to automate the process of extracting structured information from unstructured web data using modern AI techniques. Built with Python, the project leverages a combination of technologies to simplify workflows for users who need to retrieve entity-specific information quickly and efficiently.

This system integrates the following methodologies and tools:

Streamlit Dashboard: A user-friendly interface that allows seamless interaction with the system. Users can:

Upload CSV files containing entity names.
Connect to Google Sheets for dynamic data integration.
Define custom query templates to retrieve entity-specific information.
Web Scraping Integration: The project uses APIs like SerpAPI or ScraperAPI to conduct real-time web searches for each entity. These tools enable the system to fetch relevant web data, including URLs, titles, and snippets, to ensure comprehensive coverage.

Language Model Processing (OpenAI GPT): The retrieved search results are processed using OpenAIâ€™s GPT models. The system uses a user-defined query template to extract specific information (e.g., email addresses, phone numbers) from search results in a meaningful way.

Data Handling with Pandas: The project utilizes pandas for efficient data manipulation and structuring, ensuring extracted results are organized into tables for further analysis.

Google Sheets API: Integration with Google Sheets allows users to export extracted results directly, facilitating seamless sharing and collaboration.

Secrets Management: Sensitive information like API keys is securely managed using Streamlit's secrets.toml, ensuring security and integrity throughout the process.

Key Features
Customizable Queries: Users can dynamically define their information extraction needs with query templates, making the system adaptable to various use cases.
Automation: Eliminates manual effort in searching and extracting data from multiple sources.
Efficiency: Combines web scraping and LLM-powered extraction to provide precise results.
Interoperability: Supports CSV file uploads and Google Sheets integration for flexible data input and output.
Use Case Examples
Automating the collection of contact details (emails, phone numbers) for business entities.
Extracting company-related information for market research.
Gathering links and summaries for academic or technical research.
Technological Innovations
The project showcases the synergy between traditional web scraping techniques and cutting-edge Generative AI tools, demonstrating how large language models can process and structure complex data. By utilizing a modular and extensible architecture, the project highlights a scalable approach to solving real-world information retrieval problems.

This system provides a foundation for integrating AI-powered information extraction into various business and research workflows, offering speed, accuracy, and ease of use.
